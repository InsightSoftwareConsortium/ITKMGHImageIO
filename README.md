## History

The original implementation was developed in the Slicer code base (folder `Slicer/Libs/MGHImageIO`)
with contributions from Nicole Aucoin, Steve Pieper, Georghe, Dennis Jen, Bruce Fischl, Sebastien Barre, Jim Miller, Bill Lorensen,
Dominique Belhachemi, Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin, Julien Finet, Matt McCormick, Hans Johnson, Kent Williams
and Andras Lasso.

In May 2013, Hans Johnson created the repository `Slicer/itkMGHImageIO` enabling ITK
based programs to support reading and writing MGH files. See [Slicer/itkMGHImageIO@4fa1fd815](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKMGHImageIO/commit/4fa1fd8155a697bdd1a2c73f475178220d9fb09f). Between 2013 and 2021, this
more general implementation has been developed with contributions from Hans Johnson, Mathew Seng, Xiaoxiao Liu, Matt McCormick, Jon Haitz Legarreta, Fran√ßois Budin, Zach Williamson and Jean-Christophe Fillion-Robin.

In September 2015, starting with Slicer commit [Slicer/Slicer@184e907df](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/commit/184e907df), Slicer was updated to use the IO provided by `Slicer/itkMGHImageIO` through the ITK remote module mechanism.

Finally, in December 2021, the project originally created in the `Slicer` GitHub organization was transferred to the `InsightSoftwareConsortium` GitHub organization and re-forked into the Slicer one. The
ITK remote module was also updated to reference the project in the InsightSoftwareConsortium organization. See [InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK@f84c9ef09](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITK/commit/f84c9ef0903ff662e6716db2b138509505e85072).
